            <h3 id="h1-to-h1-color">Privacy when using digital assets</h3>
            <p>
              Your funding of bitcoin, XRP, ether, and other Digital Assets, may
              be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are
              distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions
              across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are
              open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and
              the unintentional revelation of private financial information,
              especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
